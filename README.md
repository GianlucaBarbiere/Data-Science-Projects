# Data-Science-Projects

Welcome to my personal repository of data science projects. This space has been created to gather and share a series of projects I have undertaken throughout my academic and professional journey in the field of data science. Here, you can find a variety of projects that showcase my skills and experiences in machine learning, data analysis, and neural networks.

The primary objective of this repository is to provide direct access to the data science projects I have completed over time. Each project has been designed to demonstrate the application of machine learning algorithms and neural networks to real-world problems, allowing anyone interested to review my work and skills.
